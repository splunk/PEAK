# Welcome to PEAK Threat Hunting

### Motivation
The <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-threat-hunting-framework.html" target="_blank"> PEAK Threat Hunting Framework</a> was developed by the SURGe Security Research team at Splunk to help defenders structure, measure, and improve their threat hunting processes. 

PEAK, an acronym for "Prepare, Execute, and Act with Knowledge," brings a fresh perspective to threat hunting. It incorporates three distinct types of hunts:

- <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-hypothesis-driven-threat-hunting.html" target="_blank">Hypothesis-Driven</a>
- <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-baseline-hunting.html" target="_blank">Baseline (AKA Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA)</a>
- <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-framework-math-model-assisted-threat-hunting.html" target="_blank">Model-Assisted Threat Hunts (M-ATH)</a>
